scripts for ShinKGS

a generic project-folder to collect and store in one place bookmarklets that aim to enrich the ShinKGS experience.

List of all the scripts:

 * background color
 
Get your eyes some rest and kill the white background.

 * rotate board
 
Rotate the board 180 degrees - can be useful to match the relay board with the streaming video, if upside down.

 * color-coded chat
 
Assign a (random) colour to each and every user in your current chatroom; their chat messages will obtain that colour! 
 
Planned
 * skins
