# scriptKGS
scripts for ShinKGS

a generic project-folder to collect and store in one place bookmarklets that aim to enrich the ShinKGS experience.

List of all the scripts:

  Script           | Short description
  ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
  background color | Get your eyes some rest and kill the white background.
  rotate board     | Rotate the board 180 degrees - can be useful to match the relay board with the streaming video, if the relayer is sitting opposite the camera.
  color-coded chat | Assign a (random) colour to each and every user in your current chatroom; their chat messages will obtain that colour!
